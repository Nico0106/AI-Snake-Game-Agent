## Snake AI

In this project we developed an agent that learns how to play the game snake and get better after training using reinforcement learning. The game snake consists of a player manoeuvring  a snake through the game field, trying to eat as many food items as it can avoiding the obstacles that appear in the game. Every time the snake eats these food items, its length increases and so does the intensity and difficulty. The game contains two modes. A single player mode and an agent mode. In the player mode the user can change the environment variables of the game before playing the game in which they are the one manoeuvring the snake though the game field. In the agent mode the user again has the option of changing the environment variables, but this time the agent is the one that will be playing the game. The player is able to watch as the agent plays, trains and learns the rules of the game and gradually increases its score. 

The main focus of this project was to develop the AI agent using Q-learning, which is a value based reinforcement learning algorithm, train it to maximise the score and analyse the performance of the agent in learning the game and adapting when the rules of the environment change. 

The primary programming language used for the implementation of the snake game and the agent was Python and the graphical interface of the game was implemented using the Pygame library.
